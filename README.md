XF-Indicator
============

Extreme Feedback Indicator
--------------------------

Always keep an eye on your continuous integration build statuses, but you don't
want an E-Mail every time a build finishes. With this indicator you have a
simple mechanism, which blends into your working environment, does not bug you
whenever a build is done, but only changes the icon whenever a status changes. 

Features
--------

- Add travis-ci.org repositories to watch
- Open latest build status in webbrowser
- Aggregate worst build status to be shown at top level
    * Order of Buildstatuses from worst to best: Failure, Not existing, Errored, Success
- Preferences window for adding/removing builds to watch
